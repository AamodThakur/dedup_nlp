892,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/South_Pole,The South Pole Traverse (or Highway) is a 1600 km trail from McMurdo Station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
893,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/South_Pole,"It's compacted snow with crevasses filled in and marked by flags. It can only be traveled by specialized tractors, hauling sleds with fuel and supplies."
894,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/South_Pole,These aren't very nimble so the trail has to take a long swerve around the Transantarctic Mountains to come onto the plateau.
895,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Cold_weather,"The most common cause for accidents in winter is slippery roads, pavements (sidewalks) and especially steps."
896,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Cold_weather,"At a minimum, you need footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are deficient."

901,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Snow_safety,"The problem is that snow is sticky, so it needs some triggering to come down, and some snow coming down can be the triggering event for the rest."
902,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Snow_safety,"Sometimes the original trigging event is the sun warming the snow, sometimes some more snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human."
903,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Tornado_safety,"A tornado is a spinning column of very low-pressure air, which sucks the surrounding air inward and upward."

909,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Regional_coding,"The media companies routinely lie about the purpose of this, claiming that it is to ""prevent piracy""."
910,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Regional_coding,"In fact, region codes have absolutely no effect on illegal copying; a bit-for-bit copy of a disk will play just fine on any device where the original will."
911,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Regional_coding,The actual purpose is to give those companies more control over their markets; it's all about money spinning.
912,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Internet_telephony,"Because calls are routed over the Internet, you do not need to use a phone company located where you live or where you travel."
913,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Internet_telephony,"There is also no requirement that you obtain a local number from the community in which you live; you can obtain a satellite Internet connection in the wilds of Chicken, Alaska and select a number which claims you're in sunny Arizona."
914,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Internet_telephony,"Often, you have to buy a global number separately that allows PSTN phones to call you. Where the number is from makes a difference for people calling you."

917,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Smartphone_apps_for_travellers,"The translation engines have improved dramatically, and now often give more or less correct translations (and more seldom gibberish), but some care is due, as they still may have gotten it all wrong."
918,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Smartphone_apps_for_travellers,"One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the desired language data."
919,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/GPS_navigation,Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone can be the easiest and most convenient way to navigate when out of your home country.

923,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Phone_service,"While most cards are good for calling anywhere, some specialise in providing favourable call rates to specific groups of countries."
924,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Phone_service,Access to these services is often through a toll-free telephone number that can be called from most phones without charge.

929,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Aggregators,Nowadays air travel is only rarely booked directly through the airline without first searching and comparing prices.
930,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Aggregators,Sometimes the same flight can have vastly differing prices at various agregators and it pays to compare search results and to also look at the website of the airline itself before booking.

934,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Studying_abroad,"For most countries, you will need an offer letter from the institution you wish to study at, and also evidence of funds to support yourself for at least the first year of your course."
935,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Studying_abroad,"Check with the institution, as well as the immigration department for the country you wish to study in for detailed requirements."
936,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Working_abroad,"Unless you are a diplomat, working overseas generally means that you will have to file income tax in the country you are based in."
937,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Working_abroad,"Income tax is structured differently in different countries, and the tax rates and brackets vary widely from one country to another."
938,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Working_abroad,"In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied both at the federal level and at the local level, so the rates and brackets can vary from region to region."
939,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Returning_home,"While immigration check is usually absent or a formality when you arrive in your homeland, customs control can be a hassle."

941,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Travel_writing,The easiest way to get started in the business of travel writing is to hone your skills on an established travel blog website.

945,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Volunteer_travel,It can also be a good way to stretch a budget to allow a longer stay somewhere since many volunteer jobs provide room and board and a few pay a small salary.
946,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Boating_on_the_Baltic_Sea,"Vikings used the Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Parts of these routes can still be used. Check possible need for special permits, which may be difficult to get."
947,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Boating_on_the_Baltic_Sea,"The White Sea–Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea, via Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Petersburg, mostly by rivers and lakes."
948,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Boating_on_the_Baltic_Sea,"Lake Onega is also connected to Volga, so coming from the Caspian Sea through Russia is still possible."
949,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hitchhiking_boats,Be assured that once you hit the marinas everything will be pretty obvious. You will meet other boat hitchhikers and they will share their information with you.
950,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hitchhiking_boats,"Basically you'll be putting up notices offering your help, pacing the docks, approaching people cleaning their yachts, trying to make contact with sailors in the bar, etc."
951,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Hitchhiking_boats,Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while everyone will know you and will give you hints as to which boat is looking for someone.

956,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Flying_to_Africa,"If you have additional travel time, check to see how your total fare quote to Africa compares with a round-the-world fare."
957,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Flying_to_Africa,"Don't forget to add in the extra costs of additional visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all those places outside of Africa."
958,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Round_the_world_flights,"If you want to fly around the world completely in the Southern Hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes."

960,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Round_the_world_flights,"However, Star Alliance covers everything except the eastern South Pacific from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight."
961,https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Round_the_world_flights,This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and the west coast of South America. (see below)
